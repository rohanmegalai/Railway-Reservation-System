# AIM:
To develop the Railway Reservation System using Star UML.

# Problem Statement:
1. Exam Registration System is used in the effective registration of exams to all of the applicants. This system adopts a comprehensive approach to minimize the manual work and schedule resources, time in a coherent manner.

2. The core of the system is to get the online registration form (with details such as name, address etc.,) filled by the applicant whose details are later verified by the Administrator.

3. Then the applicant needs to pay the examination fees by the interface provided in the Exam Registration system. After the end of the due date for submitting the form, the information is in turn forwarded to the administrator's view.

4. The applications are then processed ased on the information given by the applicant, and any forfeiting identified can make the applicant liable to penalty as per the law.

5. The administrator after successful confirmation, initiates the process to generate the hall tickets for the applicants. After successful generation of hall tickets, the system delivers the hall ticket to the applicants. The applicants can download the hall tickets finally in the end.

UML DIAGRAMS

# USE CASE DIAGRAM

A use case diagram is a graphical depiction of a user's possible interactions with a system. The use cases are represented by either circles or ellipses. The actors are often shown as stick figures.

UML is the modeling toolkit that you can use to build your diagrams. Use cases are represented with a labeled oval shape.

Stick figures represent actors in the process, and the actor's participation in the system is modeled with a line between the actor and use case.
# UML use case diagrams are ideal for:

Representing the goals of system-user interactions

Defining and organizing functional requirements in a system

Specifying the context and requirements of a system

→ Modeling the basic flow of events in a sina use case.

# CLASS DIAGRAM

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) can help you model systems in various ways. One of the more popular types in UML is the class diagram. Popular

among software engineers to document software architecture, class diagrams are a type of structure diagram because they describe what must be present in the system being modeled. No matter your level of familiarity with UML or class diagrams, our UML software is designed to be simple and easy to use.

Class diagrams offer a number of bend is for any organization. Use UML class diagrams to:

Better understand the general overview of the schematics of an application.

Visually express any specific needs of a system and disseminate that information throughout the business.

Create detailed charts that…

# ACTIVITY DIAGRAM:

The Unified Modeling Language includes several subsets of diagrams, including structure diagrams, interaction diagrants, and behavior diagrams. Activity diagrams, along with use case and state machine diagrams, are considered behavior diagrams because they describe what must happen in the system being modeled.

Stakeholders have many issues to manage, so it's important to communicate with clarity and brevity. Activity diagrams help people on the business and development sides of an organization come together to understand the same process and behavior.

Activity diagrams present a number of benefits to users. Consider creating an activity diagram to:

Demonstrate the logic of an algorithm.

Describe the steps performed in a UML use case.

# SEQUENCE DIAGRAM

A sequence diagram is a type of intera jon diagram because it describes how- and in what order a group of objects works together. These diagrams are used by software developers and business professionals to understand requirements for

a new system or to document an existing process. Sequence diagrams are sometimes known as event diagrams or event scenarios.


# BENEFITS OF SEQUENCE DIAGRAM

Sequence diagrams can be useful references for businesses and other organizations. Try drawing a sequence diagram to:

Represent the details of UML use cases.

Model the logic of a sophisticated procedure, function, or operation. See how objects and components interact with each other to complete a process.

Plan and understand the detailed functionality of an existing or future scenario.

# RESULT

Thus the project to develop Railway Reservation system was developed using Star UML Software is done successfully.
